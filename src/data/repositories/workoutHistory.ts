/**
 * What past sessions say — read across sessions, never inside one.
 *
 * Split out of `workouts.ts`, which owns the write path of the session in
 * progress. These two queries have a different audience: the exercise sheet of
 * Lot 3 reads them, the live screen of Lot 5 reads them, and the history screen
 * of Lot 7 will own them. Both walk the same composite index
 * `[exerciseId+performedAt]` from the same lower bound of 1 — an unvalidated set
 * carries `performedAt: 0` and is not history.

/**
 * RF-19 — the critical query. Runs for every exercise when the live workout
 * screen opens, and the user expects it instantly. Hence the composite index
 * and the denormalised `exerciseId`: without them this would be three cascading
 * queries (§5.1).
 *
 * The scan walks backwards and stops on the first live set rather than reading
 * the last one and filtering after: a deleted session must fall back to the one
 * before it, not blank the display.
 *
 * `excludeWorkoutId` is what keeps the column a **reference** rather than a
 * mirror. Without it, ticking today's first set makes "previous" show today's
 * first set — the query has no idea which session is on screen, and the most
 * recent validated set is by definition the one just entered.
